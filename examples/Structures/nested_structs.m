% Nested Structs — Structs inside structs
% Fields can themselves be structs, forming a hierarchy.
% Pull toolbox functions (signal, stats, graphics, io) into scope so we
% can call them by short name (fft, butter, plot, std, ...). Without this,
% we'd need fully qualified names like signal.transforms.fft(...).
