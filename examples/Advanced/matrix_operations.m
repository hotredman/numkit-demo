% Matrix Operations — Transpose, reshape, size
% Common operations for inspecting and reshaping matrices.
% Pull toolbox functions (signal, stats, graphics, io) into scope so we
% can call them by short name (fft, butter, plot, std, ...). Without this,
% we'd need fully qualified names like signal.transforms.fft(...).

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6];
