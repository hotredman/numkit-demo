% Million-Point Chirp — engine-side downsampling for huge signals
% A linear chirp sampled at 300 kHz over 5 s (~1.5M points). Above ~1M
% samples the engine ships only a compact preview to the viewer and streams
% a freshly-decimated slice each time you zoom — so the plot loads instantly
% and reveals more detail the further in you zoom, without ever moving the
% full signal into the UI.
