% Many Figures — 20 large scatter plots (WebGL context-limit stress test)
% Opens 20 separate figures, each a 50k-point scatter cloud. A naive design
% with one WebGL context per preview card would blow past the browser's
% ~16-context cap and blank the oldest thumbnails; the shared-context preview
% rasterizer draws every card from ONE context, so all 20 stay crisp and match
% their windows. Watch the Figures panel fill with thumbnails.
