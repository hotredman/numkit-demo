% Ten-Million-Point Line — GPU level-of-detail
% A 10M-sample noisy multi-tone signal. Above ~1M points the engine keeps the
% raw data engine-side and the viewer draws a GPU LOD tile (~4× the plot width
% in points), refetched only on zoom — so the plot opens instantly and pans at
% any zoom with no overdraw. Bump n to 50e6 to stress the LOD further.
