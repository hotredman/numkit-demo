% Spikes Preserved — downsampling that doesn't hide outliers
% A long, mostly-smooth signal with three sharp spikes (~500k points). The
% plot's default M4 downsampling keeps the min and max of every pixel
% column, so the spikes stay visible at any zoom level — naive subsampling
% would drop them. Zoom into a spike to watch the full sample detail appear.
