% Deconvolution — Polynomial division with deconv
% If c = conv(a, b), then deconv(c, a) recovers b.
% Pull toolbox functions (signal, stats, graphics, io) into scope so we
% can call them by short name (fft, butter, plot, std, ...). Without this,
% we'd need fully qualified names like signal.transforms.fft(...).
