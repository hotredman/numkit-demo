% Spectrogram with logarithmic frequency axis + log color scale
%
% Builds a tonal mixture whose components sit at octave intervals
% (50/100/200/400/800/1600 Hz) so the difference between linear and
% log frequency axes is dramatic — on log axes they're evenly spaced,
% on linear the lower octaves collapse into a single bottom row.
%
% Two log knobs available:
%
%   1. `colorscale('log')` BEFORE `imagesc` — the engine bakes log10
%      into the quantization at construction. Useful for power
%      spectrograms whose values span many orders of magnitude:
%      without it the colormap range gets eaten by outliers and
%      everything looks washed out.
%
%   2. Log Y axis — toggle via right-click on the figure ("Axes →
%      Y axis · log"). The image resamples to a log-distributed grid
%      on every zoom, so frequencies are evenly spaced visually
%      regardless of how zoomed-in you are.
%
% Performance notes:
%   - For a 16k×42k spectrogram (192 kHz × 1 hour, window 32768) the
%     engine quantizes to uint8 + builds a lazy LOD pyramid → ~890 MB
%     in memory and instant zoom-out via the pyramid. The example
%     here uses a smaller workload that runs in ~1 sec for fast
%     iteration; scale it up by changing Fs and dur below.
