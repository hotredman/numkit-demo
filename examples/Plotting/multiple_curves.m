% Multiple Curves — Plot sin & cos together
% Use hold on to overlay two curves on the same axes.
% Pull toolbox functions (signal, stats, graphics, io) into scope so we
% can call them by short name (fft, butter, plot, std, ...). Without this,
% we'd need fully qualified names like signal.transforms.fft(...).
